# Mohenjo-Daro

Educational Python toolkit to support creation and exploration of a model of the ancient city Mohenjo-Daro. The project provides source code, data placeholders, and helper scripts to assemble, visualize, and experiment with city reconstructions for learning and teaching purposes.

## Key points
- Purpose: educational toolkit for building and exploring a model of Mohenjo-Daro.
- Layout: source code under `src/`, data under `src/data/`, and utility scripts under `src/scripts/`.
- Status: small repository; documentation and example data may be limited.

## Quick start
1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/tempotoplay/mohenjo-daro.git
   cd mohenjo-daro

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (Python 3.8+ recommended):

   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS / Linux
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows (PowerShell)

3. Install dependencies (if a requirements file or pyproject is added):

   pip install -r requirements.txt  # or use pyproject.toml if present

4. Explore the code and example scripts in `src/` and `doc/`. Add sample data or run scripts in `src/scripts/` as provided.

## Examples and tutorials
Consider adding Jupyter notebooks or short example scripts in `doc/` to demonstrate building a simple city model from sample datasets.
