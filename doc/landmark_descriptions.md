# Landmark Guide: Mohenjo-daro

This document provides historical context and architectural details for the key landmarks represented in the Mohenjo-daro optimization project.

## I. Citadel (Acropolis)
The high mound (Citadel) was the administrative and religious center of the city, fortified by massive mud-brick walls. It contains the city's most monumental structures.

### The Great Bath (SD Area)
*   **Significance:** The earliest known public water tank in the ancient world. Likely used for ritual purification rather than general bathing.
*   **Architecture:**
    *   **Pool:** 12m x 7m rectangular pool, approx. 2.4m deep.
    *   **Waterproofing:** Constructed with finely fitted baked bricks sealed with gypsum plaster and a thick layer of bitumen (natural tar) to prevent leakage.
    *   **Features:** Steps at both ends lead into the water. Surrounded by verandas and rooms, one of which contained a well for filling the pool.

### The Granary (Great Hall)
*   **Significance:** A massive structure originally interpreted as a state granary for storing grain. Modern interpretations suggest it may have been a "Great Hall" or public reception building, as direct evidence of grain (like chaff) is scarce.
*   **Architecture:**
    *   **Foundation:** A diverse brick foundation divided into 27 square and rectangular blocks arranged in three rows.
    *   **Ventilation:** Narrow passages (air ducts) between blocks were likely designed to circulate air beneath a timber superstructure, preventing spoilage (if used for grain) or dampness.
    *   **Superstructure:** The original wooden superstructure has decayed, leaving only the brick podium.

### College of Priests (SD Area)
*   **Significance:** A large, multi-room complex located directly east of the Great Bath. Its proximity to the bath suggests it was a residence for the high priests or a college for religious instruction.
*   **Architecture:**
    *   Features a large open courtyard surrounded by numerous rooms.
    *   External walls are remarkably thick (over 4 feet), indicating it may have supported a second story.

### Buddhist Stupa (Later Addition)
*   **Significance:** A dome-shaped Buddhist shrine dating to the Kushan period (c. 2nd century CE), built nearly 2,000 years after the decline of the Indus civilization.
*   **Context:** It sits atop the highest point of the Citadel mound, burying the underlying "SD Area" ruins. Archaeologists believe it likely sits on the foundations of an original Indus-period temple or ziggurat.
*   **Status:** While anachronistic to the Harappan city, it is the site's most recognizable visual landmark today.

### Pillared Hall (Assembly Hall / L Area)
*   **Significance:** Located in the L Area south of the main Citadel mound, this large hall likely served as a place for public assemblies, governance, or social gatherings.
*   **Architecture:**
    *   Characterized by 20 square brick pillars arranged in rows (4 rows of 5 pillars each).
    *   Originally supported a large roof, creating a spacious covered area.

### Oval Well (SD Area)
*   **Significance:** Located in the SD Area near the College, this is the only well in Mohenjo-daro with an elliptical (oval) shaft.
*   **Function:** Likely served the nearby Collegiate building or was used to fill the Great Bath.

### Southeast Corner Tower
*   **Significance:** A solid baked-brick bastion protecting the southeast corner of the Citadel mound, emphasizing the defensive nature of the acropolis.

## II. Lower City
The sprawling residential and commercial districts to the east, laid out on a strict grid plan. It is divided into major excavation areas (HR, VS, DK).

### First Street (Main Street)
*   **Significance:** The central north-south axis of the Lower City, demonstrating the city's sophisticated urban planning.
*   **Architecture:** Approx. 10 meters wide—broad enough for two-way bullock cart traffic. It runs straight for nearly a kilometer, intersected at right angles by smaller lanes.

### DK Area (G & B Sectors)
*   **Context:** The northern/eastern residential district.
*   **Key Landmark:** **Priest-King Discovery Site (DK-B)**
    *   The famous steatite bust of the "Priest-King" was found here in a small hypocaust-like enclosure.
    *   This area reveals deep stratification, with walls built over earlier phases.

### HR Area (South)
*   **Context:** The southern residential district, containing some of the best-preserved large houses.
*   **Key Landmark:** **House A1 (Chief's House)**
    *   A grand residence often attributed to a wealthy merchant or civic leader.
    *   The nearby "Deadman Lane" and rooms in this area found scattered skeletons, which early excavators erroneously attributed to a massacre (the "Aryan Invasion" theory, now largely debunked).

### VS Area (West)
*   **Context:** Located on the western edge of the Lower City, closest to the Citadel.
*   **Key Function:** **Industrial Activity**
    *   Known for craft workshops, particularly elaborate **shell working**.
    *   Also contains a structure identified as a "Dyer's Workshop" due to circular brick depressions in the floor likely used to hold dyeing vats.

### Lower City Defenses
*   **Significance:** While less fortified than the Citadel, the Lower City was also protected by massive flood-defense and boundary walls to the south and west.
