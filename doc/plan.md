Refere to @3d-model-architect.md for general rules.

1. Grand plan of the city: River Indus on the west, Citadel on the east, Lower city in between. These parts are represented by 2d heightmaps.

2. Develop procedural generation algorithm for the city: 
    1. Carve out islands for known objects
    2. Fill the rest with procedural noise
        2.1 Add streets and drainage system
        2.2 Add buildings

3. Document the following:
    1. Real world size of the city
    2. Model size of the city
    3. General city plan and orienation with major landmarks
        - Citadel
        - Lower city
        - Great Bath
        - Granary
        - Assembly Hall
        - Streets and drainage system
        - Quarters
            - "Rich" quarter
            - "Poor" quarters
        - Main streets
        - Audit for missing landmarks

4. Develop method for cutting physical model from 2d heightmaps. 
    1. Create a sample map for a city block in the lower city.
    2. Figgure out how to carve the map using laser cutter (LaserPecker 2), 3mm MDF board or balsa wood (1/8 inch thick). Consider masking tape method for painting to avoid laser charring.
    
5. Depending on the results of step 4, we will develop a method for cutting physical model from 2d heightmaps and assemble it.

6. Resarch Citadel plan: enumarate all known structures and their locations. 

7. Research Lower City plan: identify major street axes, distinct neighborhoods, and industrial areas.
